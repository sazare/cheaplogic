in home directory, .sbclrc contains *MYLIB* and myload function.
and *MYLIB* is set to ~/lib/mysbcl

now 
~/lib/mysbcl/ito.lisp is soft linked to list/ito.lisp.
~/lib/mysbcl/ito-ito.lisp is soft linked to list/ito-ito.lisp.
~/lib/mysbcl/perf.lisp is soft linked to list/perf.lisp.

then

use (myload "ito.lisp") replaced (load "ito.lisp") previously.
I can use ito.
