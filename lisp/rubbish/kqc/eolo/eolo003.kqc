;; by 3, +P(a) trans to +R(a) 

;; need +R(a) validify new +R(a) or new +R(a) validify old +R(a)?
;; not old -R(a) with new +R(a) resolution

;; 3 make one way infection, not +R to +P


;; 1 is new fact
(1 () (+ R a))

; old fact
(2 () (+ P a))

; rule what this mean?
;; this means +Px -> -Rx, 
(3 (x) (- P x)(+ R x))
