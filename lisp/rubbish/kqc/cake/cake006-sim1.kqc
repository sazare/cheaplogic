;; Human actions. How muti actions expressed?
; this means, after whipped x,y to z, z is Cream
;; Cream is used after half part. 
;; In this kqc, I simply Dough and Ceram make a cake
;; Human does Whip x,y to z. means positive (+Whippr x y z)
;((x y) (+ Whippr x y z)(+ Cream z))

; Human actions be fact after human do it.
; and observed by EO.
; Bowl then Mix make Melange or Mixed something.

;; In this way, Human Action Done just remove the Action Literal.
;; It seems good for it...

;; recipe

;; Cream is made from Fresh and Sugar with whip, but Cream don't used in this phase
;; commented out this.

;; Mixpr is just removed after HA done,
