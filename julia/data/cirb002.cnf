# A simple circuit problem 
# alternate perspedtive
### not yet work

# i separete the function from structure and theory
# cycle will be cut by empty mgu 

# D is device swith and lamp
# F is flow of electricity
# S is sitch
# B is battery
# W is wire

# goal
# if switch off, how the lamp is?
[lamp].[-D(lamp,off)]
 [].[-D(black, on)]

# Structure
 [lamp,sw,bat,wire].[+F(lamp,wire,bat,wire),-S(wire),-B(bat),-W(wire)]
[lamp,sw,bat,wire].[-F(lamp,sw,bat,wire),+S(sw)]
[lamp,sw,bat,wire].[-F(lamp,sw,bat,wire),+B(bat)]
[lamp,sw,bat,wire].[-F(lamp,sw,bat,wire),+W(wire)]

# Function
 [lamp,sw,bat,wire].[+F(lamp,sw,bat,wire),-Br(lamp)]
[lamp,sw,bat,wire].[-F(lamp,sw,bat,wire),+Br(lamp)]

# Theory
[lamp,sw].[+D(lamp,sw),-Br(lamp)]
