@ a trial ML to MP -- nonsence

# MP is Mechanical Proving
# ML is Machine Learning

# given pictures a,b,c with description, A,B,C with probability

<data/common.fun

[a,p,b,q].[-Before(a,p),-After(b,q),+Prob(b,time(p,q))]

# predicate variable may be required.
# These says probability=1.0 is same without probability.
[X,x].[-X(x,1.0),+X(x)]
[X,x].[-X(x),-X(x,1.0)]
