# lamp=light, bat=charged is only solution
# OK


# i separete the function from structure and theory
# cycle will be cut by empty mgu 

# D is device swith and lamp
# F is flow of electricity
# S is sitch
# B is battery
# now forget wire for simplicity

# goal
# if switch off, the lamp should be black, any other conditions.
[d,lamp].[-Dev(d,lamp,on,charged)]

[d].[-Flow(d,light,on,charged),+Dev(d,light,on,charged)]   # 電流流れればライトはつく
[d,lamp,sw,bat].[-Work(d,lamp,sw,bat),+Flow(d,light,on,bat)] # is this correct?

# Structure
## Work? -- ? is needed for not mix the domain
# every compos work, d is the device and it may flow current
