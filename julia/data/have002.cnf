@ have, give relation, with time, changed: t2,t0 is a range of time, and any t2 means any one of t2.
# t1 is a event time

# rh1, ch1=simpleprover("data/have001.cnf",7,1)

# neg conj(I suppose conjunction)
[t2,t1].[-Have(I, orange, t2),-After(t2,t1)]

[].[+Give(You, I, orange, T1)]

# Facts
# befor t1, You have orange.
[t0,t1].[+Have(You, orange, t0),-After(t1,t0)]


# relation of Have and Give
[a,b,t0,t1,t2,x].[-Have(a, x, t0),-Give(a, b, x, t1),+Have(b, x, t2),-After(t2, t1),-After(t1, t0)]

# Time's axiom
 [t0,t1,t2].[-After(t2,t1),-After(t1,t0),+After(t2,t0)]



## In a proof, there is a time only T1. In axioms, I imagine t1,T2 as different times from T1.
## What is this?

## for existing axioms. There are times different from T0.
[].[+After(T2,T1)]
[].[+After(T1,T0)]


## using this axiom, the proof becomes unique.
## What this means?
