@ friend world can I prove a theorem from given facts.
@@ when use 3#2, simply find 1 [] and finished(all proofs aren't gotten!!)
@@ #3 is a good neg theorem for my intension. 

# Theorem
 [x,y,z].[-F(x,y),-F(y,z),+F(x,z)] #1

# neg Theorem
 [X,Y].[+F(X,Y)] #2
 [Y,Z].[+F(Y,Z)] #2
 [X,Z].[-F(X,Z)] #2

# alteranate neg
[X,Y,Z].[-F(X,Y),-F(Y,Z),-F(X,Z)] #3

# Facts
[].[+F(a,b)]
[].[+F(b,c)]
[].[+F(a,c)]
