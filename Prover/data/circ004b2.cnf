# DC5(time, lamp, switch, battery, wire)
# lamp   light,black

# DC2
[].[+DC2(on, light)]
[].[+DC2(off, black)]

# DC3
[].[+DC3(on, light, charged)]
[].[+DC3(on, black, empty)]
[x].[+DC3(off, black, x)]
# the last varible x overlap empty.

# DC4
[].[+DC4(on, light, conn)]
[x].[+DC4(off, black, x)]

# the removement of the next statement may means it is not the case.
