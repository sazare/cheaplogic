# A simple circuit problem
#  sw -- lamp -- power -->{sw} -- is wire
#  case: after sw:off and lamp:dark, let sw:on and lamp:dark
#  wire is connect or broken
#  what is the reason.

# C(time, switch, power, lamp, wire)
# time t -> s(t)
# switch on/off
# power  some,empty ; some > empty
# lamp   glow,dark
# wire   connect, broken

# X is empty?
#[t,X,z].[-C(s(t),on,X,dark,z)]
[t,X,z].[-C(t,off,X,dark,z),-C(s(t),on,X,dark,z)]
