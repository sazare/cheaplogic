# most simple circuit and full description
### goal is lamp is white which parts work

## rce3,cce3=simpleprover("data/cire003.cnf",10,10)

# julia> printproofs1(cce3)
### Too many []. whan can i do:

# julia> printmgu(:R10,cce3,true)
### no contradictions


# i separete the function from structure and theory
# cycle will be cut by empty mgu ******

# D is the device
# C is the flow of electricity
# S is a switch
# L is a lamp
# B is a battery

# goal
# if switch off, the lamp should be black, any other conditions.
## workx describe about the part. Dev say the state of it.
## they should be distinguished?

# other goals experimental
