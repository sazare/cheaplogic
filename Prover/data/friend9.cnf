@ friend law(multi goal) imaginally

# I want to know the rule hold on all constants
 for x,y assing {a,b,c} all statement should make contradiction

 # symmetric is simple. just enumeration
 [x,y].[-F(x,y),+F(y,x)]

 [].[+F(a,a)]
 [].[-F(a,a)]
 [].[+F(a,b)]
 [].[-F(a,b)]
 [].[+F(a,c)]
 [].[-F(a,c)]
 [].[+F(b,c)]
 [].[-F(b,c)]
 ... and so on

 # then transitional law
 [x,y,z].[-F(x,y),-F(y,z),-F(x,z)]
 

[].[-F(a,c)]
[].[+F(a,b)]
[].[+F(b,c)]


# Really I want to know such things?

# incomplete Hyposesys, and find a new result is it??
