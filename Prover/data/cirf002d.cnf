# circuit problem level0

# THIS IS NOT WORK.
# Cause cant be disappered

# parts are switch, lamp, battery 
# when malfunction, with the test of parts, 


# this asks what tests are needed when malfunction

# goal and facts pattern be changed to 1 clause from cirf002b.cnf

## simple +/- conversion
## Which is more fit to my intension?

# goal
## This goal ask it is malfunction or good
## This proving do after malfunction detected.

[d,w,cau].[-Cause(d,cau),-Dev(d,on,black,w)]

## The conjecture is goal and the one of fact below
## conj: +D -> +C
## then neg conj is {+D and -C}
## and choose -C as the goal
## Fact: current state of the device

#### if conj is +D and +C
#### neg conj is a clause -D,-C
## it is cirf002c.cnf
