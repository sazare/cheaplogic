# most simple circuit
## case goal is  lamp=light, what precondition

# > printmgus(ccb1)

# this shows when the lamp is black, what is the condition
#
# i separete the function from structure and theory
# cycle will be cut by empty mgu 

# D is device swith and lamp
# F is flow of electricity
# S is sitch
# B is battery
# now forget wire for simplicity

# goal
# if switch off, the lamp should be black, any other conditions.
