# A simple circuit problem separate View and Reso
# this show all reasons for your problem(goal)

#  sw -- lamp -- power -->{sw} -- is wire

# C(time, lamp,switch,power,wire)
# time t -> s(t)
# switch on/off
# power  charged,empty
# lamp   light,black
# wire   conn, cut

#[t,sw,lamp,pow,wire].[-C(t,lamp,sw,pow,wire)]
# this is your problem fo solve
# when i swhich on, but not lamp on. why?

[t,sw,lamp,pow,wire].[-C(t,black,on,pow,wire)]

# Knowledge/Premise
[t].[+C(t,light,on,charged,conn)]
