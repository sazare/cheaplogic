@ have, give relation, with time
# T1 is a event time

# neg conj(I suppose conjunction)
[t2].[-Have(I, orange, t2),-After(t2,T1)]

[].[+Give(You, I, orange, T1)]

# Facts
# befor T1, You have orange.
[t0].[+Have(You, orange, t0),-After(T1,t0)]


# relation of Have and Give
[a,b,t0,t2,x].[-Have(a, x, t0),-Give(a, b, x, T1),+Have(b, x, t2),-After(t2, T1),-After(T1, t0)]

# Time's axiom
 [t0,t1,t2].[-After(t2,t1),-After(t1,t0),+After(t2,t0)]


# rh1, ch1=simpleprover("data/have001.cnf",7,1)

## In a proof, there is a time only T1. In axioms, I imagine t1,t2 as different times from T1.
## What is this?

## for existing axioms. There are times different from T0.
[].[+After(T2,T1)]
[].[+After(T1,T0)]

#[t2].[+After(t2,T1)]
#[t0].[+After(T1,t0)]

## using this axiom, the proof becomes unique.
## What this means?
