# most simple circuit
## case goal is  sw=off then?

## rcb1,ccb1=simpleprover("data/cird002.cnf",5,5)

# > printmgus(ccb1)
# R1:<L4:L3>=lamp/black;
# R2:<L2_R1:L11>=
# R3:<L10_R2:L9>=lamp/black;
# R6:<L8_R3:L5>=
# ---

# this shows when sw is off, the lamp is black
#
# but parameter 5,5 to 10,10 the simpleprover seems not finished soon.



# i separete the function from structure and theory
# cycle will be cut by empty mgu 

# D is device swith and lamp
# F is flow of electricity
# S is sitch
# B is battery
# now forget wire for simplicity

# goal
# if switch off, the lamp should be black, any other conditions.
