readcore recognize the first char of each line

! evaluate line[2:end]
< include another cnf file(as common.fun)
& canonicalform


I use the other first char as below some days.
Now I forgot about such rules.

space -- any comment
@     -- what is written
@@    -- how to write
#     -- 

file for 
common.fun -- common func
