# circuit problem level0

# this is a special simple version of circuit problem
# this asks if good or malfunction on a calibration

# goal
## This goal ask it is malfunction or good

[d,what].[-What(d,what)]

## Fact: what state of the device(choose one of 3)
#[d].[+Dev(d,on,white)]
#[d].[+Dev(d,off,black)]
[d].[+Dev(d,on,black)]

# axioms of functions.
[d].[-Dev(d,on,white),+What(d,good)]
[d].[-Dev(d,off,black),+What(d,good)]
[d].[-Dev(d,on,black),+What(d,mal)]

# 1. d has no significant role.
